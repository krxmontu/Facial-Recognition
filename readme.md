# Real-Time Face Recognition WebCam using face-api.js

## Vision
The Real-Time Face Recognition WebCam project aims to leverage modern machine learning techniques to perform real-time facial recognition through a web interface. This project is designed to provide users with a seamless experience in detecting and recognizing faces using their webcam. By integrating face recognition APIs and advanced JavaScript libraries, the system efficiently matches faces against a reference image and displays relevant information such as age, gender, and recognition results.

## Flowchart

1. **Start**
   - User accesses the web application.
2. **Load Models**
   - The system loads pre-trained face recognition models.
3. **Access Webcam**
   - The application requests permission to access the user's webcam.
4. **Capture Video Feed**
   - The webcam video feed is displayed on the screen.
5. **Image Upload**
   - User uploads a reference image for facial recognition.
6. **Process Reference Image**
   - The uploaded image is processed to detect and extract facial features.
7. **Face Detection**
   - The system continuously analyzes the video feed to detect faces.
8. **Face Matching**
   - Detected faces are compared against the reference image.
9. **Display Results**
   - Information such as age, gender, and recognition status is shown on the screen.
10. **End**
